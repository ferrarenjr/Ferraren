            <p>Hi! My name is Nilo Ferraren Jr., and I am a first year Computer Science student studying
                 in Silliman University. My programming journey started in senior high school during a work 
                 immersion project, where I had the task of creating programs that will help monitor the water 
                 levels of a nearby river. Since childhood, i've been fascinated by technology and how things 
                 work behind the scenes. I believe that technology has the power to enhance the quality of life,
                  and im determined to help make that vision a reality. By using practical, innovative tech solutions 
                  in everyday life, I aim to contribute to a future where technology makes life easier.  
            </p>
